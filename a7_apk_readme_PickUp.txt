3. If your app has any special requirements (for example, works best on a certain device due to using maps and gps OR the app requires a certain API level on the emulators) then turn in a a7_apk_readme_<appname>.txt file as well. If your app has no special requirements this file is not required. (This is different than the readme from the project.) Include in this readme any login instructions we may need. For example a webserver you set up that the app accesses, but requires a login.
